Most people use CPU (Central Processing Unit) and processor interchangeably to refer to the main chip that executes instructions in a computer.
Example: Intel Core i7, AMD Ryzen → both are CPUs/processors.

Processor is a broader term that can refer to any chip that processes data.

GPU → Graphics processor

DSP → Digital signal processor
p;l;l
NPU → Neural processor

CPU is specifically the general-purpose
CPU = The main “brain” of the computer.

Processor = Any chip that processes data (CPU, GPU, NPU, etc.).


A core is a smaller processing unit inside a CPU or processor.

Think of it like this:

Processor (CPU) = The whole “brain.”

Core = One “thinking unit” inside that brain.
